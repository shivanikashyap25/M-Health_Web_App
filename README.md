ML-Health Web Application
This project focuses on developing a web-based platform integrated with machine learning algorithms to address challenges related to heart disease and breast cancer. The platform allows users to select from two datasets—heart attack or breast cancer—and apply various machine learning models, including:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
XGBoost
Key Features:
Dataset Insights: Users can explore basic information, such as the total number of records and the number of classes in each dataset.
Data Visualization: The platform generates graphs for better visualization, aiding in data comprehension.
Model Performance Evaluation: Each model's performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and mean squared error, enabling users to select the most effective model for their needs.
Predictive Capabilities:
Users can input their health indicators, such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and heart rate. The selected model then estimates the likelihood of developing heart disease or breast cancer based on these inputs.

Purpose:
In addition to predicting health risks, the platform emphasizes evaluating the performance of different machine learning models. This dual focus assists users in both gaining predictive healthcare insights and understanding which algorithms perform best in real-world scenarios.

Overall, the ML-Health Web Application serves as a comprehensive tool for health risk prediction and model evaluation, empowering users to make informed decisions regarding their healthcare.
